# Summarize Blog & News Article Plugin

A powerful plugin for IntelliJ that summarizes blog posts and news articles using the OLM (Open Language Model) API with LLaMA.

## What it does

This plugin uses the OLM API to generate summaries of selected files or entire projects. Simply select a file, either by clicking on it in the code editor or by dragging and dropping it into the suggested existing files section. The plugin will then fetch the article's content from the web, parse it using natural language processing techniques, and generate a concise summary.
